``` MYSQL
SELECT s.customer_id, s.plan_id, p.plan_name, s.start_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
```

I'll choose 3 customers and write about their onboarding journey:

`customer 1`

- Customer 1 started the free trial on 1 Aug 2020.
- Customer 1 then subscribed to the basic monthly plan on 8 Aug 2020 after the 7-days trial has ended.

`customer 6`

- Customer 11 started the free trial on 19 Nov 2020.
- The customer terminated subscription after free trial and churned on 26 Nov 2020 until the paid subscription ended.

`customer 16`

- Customer 16 started the free trial on 31 May 2020

- Customer 16 then upgraded to pro annual on 21 Oct 2020
